Please write your name and Student Id

There are three parts, and the number of questions to be attempted is indicated in each part. 

How should you use the allotted time?

Scan the whole question paper once. While reading the question paper, you can mark questions as E or M, or D. E for those questions that you think are easy, M for those that you think are moderately difficult, and D for those questions you think are difficult. 

Start solving questions that you have marked E followed by M and D. 

Almost always, students think that the question is easy and is done, and they submit the answer sheet. Later they regret that they should have verified their answers once again. Therefore, I recommend you verify and correct the answers instead of submitting the exam early.

Where to write your answers? 

There is sufficient space for your answer right after the question. However, you can use extra pages and attach the same at appropriate places [insert the answers right after the corresponding questions]. 

Resources that you can use? 

It's a closed book, closed notes, and a closed computing devices exam. You can, however, use a calculator, and a handwritten A4-size cheat sheet (both sides) is allowed, and the cheat sheet should be submitted along with the answers sheets.

Alarm the clock to time yourself.

If you have a letter of accommodation, consider the flexibility granted.  

Partial grading?

Make sure you write the as accurate output as possible. Good answers shall be rewarded.

Some questions may have multiple subquestions. Make sure you answer all parts of the question. If you answer only partial questions, partial grades shall be awarded.

I focus on the process, so if you dont know the complete answer. Write down your approach in simple English. 

How to submit?

Once you are done, please take pictures to convert them to a pdf (you can use Android or iOS apps to do that automatically) and then upload them to the corresponding repository on your GitHub as soon as possible. 

The time spent printing, scanning, and uploading SHALL be counted. 

Opportunity to ask questions?

Since this is a take-home exam, I cannot make myself available round the clock. Therefore, there would be no opportunity for asking questions or clarifications. If there is any confusion, please assume and write your assumptions and solve the question based on the assumption. 

I declare that I will not share this exam with anyone at any point.
